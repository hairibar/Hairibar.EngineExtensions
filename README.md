# Hairibar.EngineExtensions
Hairibar.EngineExtensions is mostly a collection of utility and extension functions that I have written for Unity over time. You are free to use this package, though keep in mind that this is a personal library that may change substantially.

## How to install
Add the following dependencies to your manifest.json:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "com.hairibar.naughtyattributes": "https://github.com/hairibar/NaughtyAttributes.git#v2.2.1"
    "com.hairibar.engineextensions": "https://github.com/hairibar/Hairibar.EngineExtensions.git#upm"
    ...
  }
}
```
